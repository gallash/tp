# tp
Short for 'teleport'.
Who doesn't love launching a terminal right after booting the PC, and navigating through lots and lots of `cd`, `ls` to find the directory where you want to resume working from the night before? Me. So I built this short command to solve this small yet annoying inconvenience.

Simply save the directory you want fast access to, giving it an alias, and tp into it later from anywhere.
